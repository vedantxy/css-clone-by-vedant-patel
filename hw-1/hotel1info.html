                    <div class="hotel1infofont23">A few minutes away from the Pench National Park, lies the beguilingly luxurious Baghvan, A Taj Safari. Befittingly deriving its name from the term ‘tiger forest’, 12 stand-alone colonial bungalows lay hidden amongst trees near a dry riverbed or nullah. Close encounters with wildlife will not come as a surprise as the pebbled riverbed becomes a pathway for animals living on the forest fringes during summer. The rooms themselves offer aesthetic interiors along with individual open air machans. A cacophony of sounds from birds, monkeys, distant jackals and the occasional roar blend into a musical reverie apt for a jungle. The colonial theme continues into the main bungalow that is tastefully decorated with varied textures and colours. An open lounge, dining space and library offer the perfect backdrop for interacting with other guests over sundowners and high tea. An outdoor pool with relaxing charpoys, lantern-lit pathways and a serene wellness centre ensure a heavenly retreat. Culinary jaunts are best enjoyed in innovative settings by the pool or the riverside and even under a Mahua tree with the theatre of an interactive kitchen. The staff abound with interesting stories and go out of their way to make your stay comfortable at our resort in Pench National Park. It is this exemplary warmth that will keep you feeling at home in the wild.</div>
