                    <div class="hotel1infofont23">Along the banks of the forested Banjaar River and nestled deep in the heart of tiger territory, Banjaar Tola, a Taj Safari, transforms wilderness living into an art. Adjoining the alluring Kanha National Park, this luxurious lodge allows you to commune with nature in an evocative atmosphere. With sunlight filtering through towering sal trees and grasslands dotted with limpid pools, the National Park provides dramatic photo opportunities. A place where nature thrives, Banjaar Tola offers guests a memorable and sustainable experience with dining decks, intimate sitting areas and an organic garden. Two elegant camps of nine tents each boast of terraced lounges, pools, Gond artwork and Bastar bell metal work that highlight local culture. Awaken to the sound of the gushing river and wilderness views as dedicated butlers attend to your every need. Feast on light Indian cuisine laced with tribal flavours at the lodge or enjoy an enthralling Bush Dinner experience. Revel in the magnificent outdoor pool and venture into the wild on safaris and guided nature walks with our naturalists. Stay at Banjaar Tola, a Taj Safari for a sensorial experience that lets you immerse yourself in the majesty of the jungle.</div>
